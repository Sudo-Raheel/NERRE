In this study, by establishing a life cycle assessment framework, GHG emissions from the production of lithium-ion batteries in China are estimated. The results show that for the three types of most commonly used lithium-ion batteries, the (LFP) battery, the (NMC) battery and the (LMO) battery, the GHG emissions from the production of a 28 kWh battery are 3061 kgCO2-eq, 2912 kgCO2-eq and 2705 kgCO2-eq, respectively. This implies around a 30% increase in GHG emissions from vehicle production compared with conventional vehicles. The productions of cathode materials and wrought aluminum are the dominating contributors of GHG emissions, together accounting for around three quarters of total emissions. From the perspective of process energy use, around 40% of total emissions are associated with electricity use, for which the GHG emissions in China are over two times higher than the level in the United States.

First we show high performance in a vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB), specifically a limiting situation in which the cell losses are ohmic in nature and derive from electrolyte conductance. Based on that case, we analyze the analogous limiting behavior of non-aqueous (NA) systems using a series of calculations assuming similar ohmic losses, scaled by the relative electrolyte resistances, with a higher voltage redox couple assumed for the NA battery. The results indicate that the NA battery performance is limited by the low electrolyte conductivity to a fraction of the performance of the VRFB.

Nevertheless, although transport in superconducting wires is perfectly lossless for direct current, transport of radio-frequency signals can be dissipative in the presence of quasiparticle excitations above the superconducting gap. Moreover, the exact mechanism of this dissipation in Josephson junctions has never been fully resolved experimentally. In particular, Josephson's key theoretical prediction that quasiparticle dissipation should vanish in transport through a junction when the phase difference across the junction is (ref. 2) has never been observed. This subtle effect can be understood as resulting from the destructive interference of two separate dissipative channels involving electron-like and hole-like quasiparticles. Here we report the experimental observation of this quantum coherent suppression of quasiparticle dissipation across a Josephson junction. As the average phase bias across the junction is swept through, we measure an increase of more than one order of magnitude in the energy relaxation time of a superconducting artificial atom. This striking suppression of dissipation, despite the presence of lossy quasiparticle excitations above the superconducting gap, provides a powerful tool for minimizing decoherence in quantum electronic systems and could be directly exploited in quantum information experiments with superconducting quantum bits. \u00a9 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Ceria nanofibers were synthesized as soot oxidation catalysts. The morphology of the catalyst was tailored to maximize the contact between the soot particles and the catalyst. Of the synthesized catalysts, the fibrous shape was the most active toward soot oxidation: the peak combustion temperature was reduced from 600\u00b0C (non-catalytic combustion) to 375\u00b0C during tight contact, 428\u00b0C during prolonged loose contact (see detailed definition in the text), and 553\u00b0C during loose contact. These results were compared to a very active ceria catalyst generated using the Solution Combustion Synthesis method and characterized by its high porosity and SSA surface. However, although the nanofibers have one fifth of the BET that the nanopowders obtained with SCS have, they display almost the same activity under tight conditions and considerably better activity during prolonged loose contact: their peak temperature was 31\u00b0C lower than the peak temperature for SCS-obtained nanopowders during the latter.

However, in composite systems, such as W-Cu, solid solubility in the liquid is almost negligible, and densification is hindered by the low amount of total mass transport. In this case, solid-state sintering of the skeletal solid structure in the presence of the liquid is a significant densification mechanism. In this article, the relative contributions to densification of both liquid and solid mass transport mechanisms are considered. A computer simulation is constructed to predict the densification behavior and concurrent microstructural development of liquidphase sintered composites for realistic heating cycles. Governing differential equations for densification are derived from idealized models of the microstructure, considering grain size, diffusion distance from vacancy source to sink, pore size, and pore morphology. Temperature-dependent terms, including the diffusivity, solubility, and surface energy, govern densification and microstructural parameters, such as the grain size, dihedral angle, and contiguity. Predictions for the sintered density, grain size, and contiguity are compared to experimental results for the W-Cu and W-Cu-Ni systems with approximately 20 vol pct liquid. For W-Cu, which has almost no intersolubility, solid-state sintering of W in the presence of liquid Cu is the dominant densification mechanism. Nickel additions increase solid solubility in the liquid and improve typical liquid-phase sintering contributions to densification. Alternatively, high sintered densities can be achieved in the absence of solubility with a sufficiently small particle size due to the solid-state contribution.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": [{"name": "", "formula": "W-Cu", "description": ["composite system", "sintered"], "acronym": "", "structure_or_phase": [""], "applications": [""]}, {"name": "", "formula": "W-Cu-Ni", "description": ["composite system", "sintered"], "acronym": "", "structure_or_phase": [""], "applications": [""]}, {"name": "", "formula": "Cu", "description": [""], "acronym": "", "structure_or_phase": ["liquid"], "applications": [""]}], "gpt3_completion": [{"acronym": "", "applications": [""], "name": "", "formula": "W-Cu", "structure_or_phase": [""], "description": [""]}, {"acronym": "", "applications": [""], "name": "", "formula": "W-Cu-Ni", "structure_or_phase": [""], "description": [""]}]}, {"prompt": "Electrical conductivity of PUR/MWCNT nanocomposites in the molten state, during crystallization and in the solid state\nThe electrical conductivity of a nanocomposite constituted of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) dispersed in a semicrystalline polyurethane matrix, is investigated during cooling from the melt to the solid state.
