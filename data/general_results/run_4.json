We couple the results of a 3-D spherical thermochemical convection model of the lunar mantle to a 1-D thermodynamic model of its core. The energy and entropy budget of the core are computed to determine the inner core growth rate and its efficiency to power a dynamo.

Here, we report the effect of the incorporation of cobalt atoms in the chemical state of the Co-MoS x catalyst, which gives rise to the co-catalytic effect. Co-MoS x catalysts with various Co contents were prepared on carbon fiber paper by a simple hydrothermal process.

Ionospheric and thermospheric modeling on time scales ranging from a few minutes to several days is fundamental for predicting space weather effects on the Earth's ionosphere and thermosphere. Space weather affects telecommunications, navigation and positioning systems, radars, and technology in space. We start with an overview of the physical effects of space weather on the upper atmosphere and on systems operating at this regime. Recent research on drivers and development of proxies applied to support space weather modeling efforts are presented, with emphasis on solar radiation indices, solar wind drivers and ionospheric indices. The models are discussed in groups corresponding to the physical effects they are dealing with, i.e. bottomside ionospheric effects, trans-ionospheric effects, neutral density and scale height variations, and spectacular space weather effects such as auroral emissions. Another group of models dealing with global circulation are presented here to demonstrate 3D modeling of the space environment. Where possible we present results concerning comparison of the models' performance belonging to the same group. Finally we give an overview of European systems providing products for the specification and forecasting of space weather effects on the upper atmosphere, which have implemented operational versions of several ionospheric and thermospheric models. \u00a9 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": [], "gpt3_completion": []}, {"prompt": "Geometric modular action and spacetime symmetry groups\nA condition of geometric modular action is proposed as a selection principle for physically interesting states on general space-times.

The interdiffusivities and intrinsic diffusivities of Ca2+ and Fe2+ have been determined in the limited FeO solid-solution range. Based on the obtained results, a solid-state reaction model of the system has been developed, taking account of the formation of the Ca2Fe2O5 phase.

Supramolecular protein assemblies are formed by self-association of multiple copies of single small-sized proteins. Because of their high degree of local order, solid-state NMR spectra of such systems exhibit an unusually high level of resolution, rendering them an ideal target for solid-state NMR investigations. Recently, our group has solved the structure of one particular supramolecular assembly, the type-iii-secretion-system needle. The needle subunit comprises around 80 residues. Many interesting supramolecular assemblies with unknown structure have subunits larger in size, which requires development of tailored solid-state NMR strategies to address their structures. In this \u201cPerspective\u201d article, we provide a view on different approaches to enhance sensitivity and resolution in biological solid-state NMR with a focus on the possible application to supramolecular assemblies with large subunit sizes.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": [], "gpt3_completion": []}, {"prompt": "Laser Doppler velocimetry using powerful solid-state light sources\nOpto-electronic measurement techniques are well established in fluid flow investigations. Their advantages are that they are non-intrusive, provide highly accurate measurement data and have fast response times. Laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) is one of the most important methods for velocity measurements with high spatial and temporal resolution. Diode lasers and diode-pumped solid-state lasers as well as glass fibres and micro-optics are employed to an increasing extent. Particularly, the development of solid-state lasers proceeds rapidly. New lasers with improved properties such as high-power fundamental-mode emission make it possible to develop enhanced LDV sensor heads. This may open up new fields of application, for example in medicine and aerospace technology. The aim of this review is to describe the present state-of-the-art in LDV and to demonstrate how new laser concepts can still contribute to the development of new, improved LDV sensors. For that purpose, solid-state lasers such as diode lasers and diode-pumped solid-state lasers are introduced, and concepts of communication engineering for accomplishing directional multi-component velocity measurements are discussed. Also, velocity measurements with high spatial resolution are reported. A conclusive overview of applications and an outlook on future challenges are outlined. \u00a9 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": [], "gpt3_completion": []}, {"prompt": "Direct structural understanding of a topochemical solid state photopolymerization reaction\nHitherto, direct structural characterization of polycrystalline product phases obtained in solid state polymerization reactions has been limited by the lack of appropriate experimental techniques for structure determination. This paper demonstrates the opportunity to apply modern powder X-ray diffraction techniques for carrying out complete structure determination in such cases, by reporting the structural properties of the polymer phase obtained in the solid state photopolymerization reaction of 2,5-distyrylpyrazine. The structure of the polymer phase, for which structure solution was carried out using the direct-space genetic algorithm technique followed by Rietveld refinement, demonstrates directly the topochemical nature of this solid state reaction. \u00a9 2008 American Chemical Society.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": [{"name": "2,5-distyrylpyrazine", "formula": "", "description": ["photopolymer"], "acronym": "", "structure_or_phase": [""], "applications": [""]}], "gpt3_completion": [{"name": "2,5-distyrylpyrazine", "formula": "", "description": ["polymer"], "acronym": "", "structure_or_phase": [""], "applications": ["photopolymerization"]}]}]
