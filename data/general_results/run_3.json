Li-ion battery is one of the most important technological alternatives for high capacity energy storage and related industrial applications. State of Health (SoH) of Li-ion batteries plays a critical role in their deployment from economic, safety, and availability aspects. Most, if not all, of the studies related to SoH estimation focus on the measurement of a new parameter/physical phenomena related to SoH, or development of new statistical/computational methods using several parameters. This paper presents a new approach for SoH estimation for Li-ion battery systems with multiple battery cells: The main idea is a new circuit topology which enables separation of battery cells into two groups, main and test batteries, whenever a SoH related measurement is to be conducted. All battery cells will be connected to the main battery during the normal mode of operation. When a measurement is needed for SoH estimation, some of the cells will be separated from the main battery, and SoH estimation related measurements will be performed on these units. Compared to classical SoH measurement methods which deal with whole battery system, the proposed method estimates the SoH of the system by separating a small but representative set of cells. While SoH measurements are conducted on these isolated cells, remaining cells in the main battery continue to function in normal mode, albeit in slightly reduced performance levels.

On the other hand, high entropy alloys (HEAs), which can also be obtained by mechanochemical processes, are a good candidate to replace the current binder phase in cermets because they exhibit high strength and ductility at high temperature and good resistance to both wear and corrosion. In this work, a new family of CSCs based on (Ti,Ta,Nb)CxN1\u2212x with HEAs belonging to the Fe-Co-Ni-Cr-Mn-V system as the binder phase is developed by mechanochemical processes. With only two constituent phases, these cermets have a simple microstructure but a high compositional complexity because both the ceramic and binder phases are complex solid solutions with at least five components.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": [{"acronym": "", "applications": ["cermet"], "name": "", "formula": "Ti(C,N)", "structure_or_phase": [""], "description": [""]}, {"acronym": "", "applications": ["cermet"], "name": "", "formula": "(Ti,Ta,Nb)CxN1\u2212x", "structure_or_phase": [""], "description": [""]}, {"acronym": "", "applications": ["cermet binder", "high entropy alloy"], "name": "", "formula": "Fe-Co-Ni-Cr-Mn-V", "structure_or_phase": [""], "description": ["system"]}], "gpt3_completion": [{"acronym": "", "applications": ["cermet"], "name": "", "formula": "Ti(C,N)", "structure_or_phase": [""], "description": [""]}, {"acronym": "", "applications": ["cermet"], "name": "", "formula": "Ti(C,N)(xN1\u2212x)", "structure_or_phase": [""], "description": [""]}, {"acronym": "", "applications": ["cermet"], "name": "", "formula": "Fe-Co-Ni-Cr-Mn-V", "structure_or_phase": [""], "description": ["binder phase"]}]}, {"prompt": "Superconductivity and thermoelectric power of Pr1.85Ce0.15CuO4-y\nWe have prepared Ce4+-doped Pr2CuO4 (Pr1.85Ce0.15CuO4-y) samples with different oxygen contents by annealing at various temperatures under argon atmosphere.

The size of organic molecules used in various catalytic transformations is often ca. 0.5-1 nm, whereas nanoparticles in the range 2-4 nm are used in supported heterogeneous catalysts. Proposed quantitative treatment of a heterogeneous catalytic mechanism with two kinetically significant steps assumes that a finite number of molecules per a single metal cluster can be adsorbed. A general equation with polynomial terms in the numerator and the denominator is derived for nonideal (nonuniform) surfaces when all kinetic and adsorption constants depend on the spatial arrangements of reacting molecules. A simplified case of a two-step catalytic cycle is discussed, with the first step being adsorption on nanoclusters and the second one being further transformation of absorbed species. The corresponding kinetic equations are derived and numerically analyzed for the case of ideal (uniform) surfaces as well as the presence of induced nonuniformity, when contrary to the ideal case there are lateral interactions between adsorbed species. The form of kinetic equations allows not only saturation, typical for Eley-Rideal kinetics, but also positive cooperativity, i.e., S-shaped behavior of the reaction rate as a function of substrate concentration.

Since the discovery that ceria is an active catalyst for selective hydrogenation of alkynes, there has been much debate on the catalytic mechanism. In this work, we propose, based on density functional theory (DFT) investigations, a mechanism that involves the heterolytic dissociation of H2 at oxygen vacancies of CeO2(111), facilitated by frustrated Lewis pairs consisting of spatially separated O and Ce sites. The resulting O-H and Ce-H species effectively catalyze the hydrogenation of acetylene, avoiding the overstabilization of the C2H3\u2217 intermediate in a previously proposed mechanism. On the basis of our mechanism, we propose the doping of ceria by Ni as a means to create oxygen vacancies. Interestingly, the Ni dopant is not directly involved in the catalytic reaction, but serves as a single-atom promoter. Experimental studies confirm the design principles and demonstrate much higher activity for Ni-doped ceria in selective hydrogenation of acetylene. The combined results from DFT calculations and experiment provide a basis to further develop selective hydrogenation catalysts based on earth-abundant materials.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": [{"acronym": "", "applications": ["catalyst", "selective hydrogenation of alkynes"], "name": "ceria", "formula": "CeO2", "structure_or_phase": [""], "description": ["Ni-doped"]}], "gpt3_completion": [{"acronym": "", "applications": ["catalyst", "selective hydrogenation of alkynes"], "name": "ceria", "formula": "CeO2", "structure_or_phase": [""], "description": ["Ni-doped"]}, {"acronym": "", "applications": ["catalyst", "selective hydrogenation of alkynes"], "name": "", "formula": "Ni", "structure_or_phase": [""], "description": [""]}]}, {"prompt": "Improved Soot Combustion in DPF Catalyzed by Ceria Nanofibers: The Importance of Soot-catalyst Contact\nCopyright \u00a9 2013 SAE International. Ceria nanofibers were synthesized as soot oxidation catalysts. The morphology of the catalyst was tailored to maximize the contact between the soot particles and the catalyst. Of the synthesized catalysts, the fibrous shape was the most active toward soot oxidation: the peak combustion temperature was reduced from 600\u00b0C (non-catalytic combustion) to 375\u00b0C during tight contact, 428\u00b0C during prolonged loose contact (see detailed definition in the text), and 553\u00b0C during loose contact. These results were compared to a very active ceria catalyst generated using the Solution Combustion Synthesis method and characterized by its high porosity and SSA surface. However, although the nanofibers have one fifth of the BET that the nanopowders obtained with SCS have, they display almost the same activity under tight conditions and considerably better activity during prolonged loose contact: their peak temperature was 31\u00b0C lower than the peak temperature for SCS-obtained nanopowders during the latter. This encourages us to investigate the interaction between the morphology and real contact conditions between the catalyst and soot in Diesel Particulate Filters (DPF) and to tailor the DPF catalytic support toward enhancing this contact while maintaining the low pressure drop associated with the catalytic layer.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": [{"acronym": "", "applications": ["catalyst", "redox"], "name": "ceria", "formula": "CeO2", "structure_or_phase": [""], "description": ["nanoclusters", "nanoparticles"]}], "gpt3_completion": [{"name": "ceria", "formula": "", "description": ["nanofibers"], "acronym": "", "structure_or_phase": [""], "applications": ["soot combustion catalyst"]}, {"name": "", "formula": "", "description": ["nanopowders"], "acronym": "SCS", "structure_or_phase": [""], "applications": ["soot combustion catalyst"]}]}, {"prompt": "Characterization of DNA duplex unzipping through a sub-2 nm solid-state nanopore\nHerein, the unzipping and translocation of DNA duplexes through a sub-2 nm silicon nitride (SiNx) solid-state nanopore have been demonstrated by well-resolved three-level blockades.

Herein is chronicled the first report of pseudocapacitance in a system devoid of liquid electrolytes, using the cathode material LiTiS2. It is demonstrated that due to extreme crystallite reduction to less than 3 nm, additional charge storage is derived by reducing surface Ti3+ to Ti2+ at higher voltages and more reversibly than traditionally shown. Due to facile diffusion pathways in 3-fold coordinated lithium along the TiS2 surfaces, disordered LiTiS2 can be used as a singular cathode without conductive additives. The result is a system exhibiting nearly 300 mA h g\u22121 at a rate of C/2 for 1000 cycles.
