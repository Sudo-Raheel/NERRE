The prevention of attacks from nuclear weapons is becoming more difficult, and nuclear forensics is a deterrent by providing detailed information on any type of nuclear event for proper attribution. One component of the nuclear forensic analysis is a measurement of the neutron spectrum. As an example, the neutron component provides information on the composition of the weapons, whether boosting is involved or the mechanisms used in creating a supercritical state. As 6Li has a large cross-section for thermal neutrons, the lithium battery is a primary candidate for assessing the neutron spectrum after detonation. The absorption process for 6Li yields tritium, which can be measured at a later point after the nuclear event, as long as the battery can be processed in a manner to successfully extract the tritium content. In addition, measuring the activated constituents after exposure provides a means to reconstruct the incident neutron spectrum. The battery consists of a spiral or folded layers of material that have unique, energy dependent interactions associated with the incident neutron flux. A detailed analysis on the batteries included a pre-irradiated mass spectrometry analysis to be used as input for neutron spectrum reconstruction.

The conclusion of the analysis is that the dipolar contribution to the internal energy acts as an initiation of disordering along the MnO/Cu3Pd interface but that the configurational entropy determines the extension of the disordered area.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": [{"acronym": "", "applications": [""], "name": "", "formula": "Cu3Pd", "structure_or_phase": ["L12 ordering"], "description": [""]}, {"acronym": "", "applications": [""], "name": "", "formula": "MnO", "structure_or_phase": [""], "description": ["precipitate"]}], "gpt3_completion": [{"acronym": "", "applications": [""], "name": "", "formula": "Cu3Pd", "structure_or_phase": ["L12"], "description": ["alloy", "with MnO precipitates"]}, {"acronym": "", "applications": [""], "name": "", "formula": "MnO", "structure_or_phase": [""], "description": ["precipitates"]}]}, {"prompt": "Phase field model for coupled displacive and diffusive microstructural processes under thermal loading\nA non-isothermal phase field model that captures both displacive and diffusive phase transformations in a unified framework is presented. The model is developed in a formal thermodynamic setting, which provides guidance on admissible constitutive relationships and on the coupling of the numerous physical processes that are active. Phase changes are driven by temperature-dependent free-energy functions that become non-convex below a transition temperature. Higher-order spatial gradients are present in the model to account for phase boundary energy, and these terms necessitate the introduction of non-standard terms in the energy balance equation in order to satisfy the classical entropy inequality point-wise. To solve the resulting balance equations, a Galerkin finite element scheme is elaborated. To deal rigorously with the presence of high-order spatial derivatives associated with surface energies at phase boundaries in both the momentum and mass balance equations, some novel numerical approaches are used. Numerical examples are presented that consider boundary cooling of a domain at different rates, and these results demonstrate that the model can qualitatively reproduce the evolution of microstructural features that are observed in some alloys, especially steels.

The exceptional stability of graphite electrodes containing poly(acrylic acid) sodium salt (PAA-Na) and carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt (CMC-Na), respectively, in a PC-rich electrolyte is explained through the understanding of binder swelling and functionality. Interfacial resistances and electrochemical stability were investigated with impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic cycling. Electrode morphologies and distributions of material were analysed with SEM and EDX.

Progressing from previous reports, a maximum capacity retention of 140mAhg\u22121 is attained in the potential window from 1.5 to 4.2V (Li/Li0) during ten cycles at C/15. The low capacity retention at extended cycling has been associated to the participation of irreversible oxygen redox process evaluated by theoretical calculations and cyclic voltammetry. These processes are minimized when the cycling potential window is confined from 2.0 to 3.8V (Li/Li0), thus, achieving a higher capacity retention up to 100mAhg\u22121 during 60cycles.

Proposed quantitative treatment of a heterogeneous catalytic mechanism with two kinetically significant steps assumes that a finite number of molecules per a single metal cluster can be adsorbed.

Since the discovery that ceria is an active catalyst for selective hydrogenation of alkynes, there has been much debate on the catalytic mechanism. In this work, we propose, based on density functional theory (DFT) investigations, a mechanism that involves the heterolytic dissociation of H2 at oxygen vacancies of CeO2(111), facilitated by frustrated Lewis pairs consisting of spatially separated O and Ce sites. The resulting O-H and Ce-H species effectively catalyze the hydrogenation of acetylene, avoiding the overstabilization of the C2H3\u2217 intermediate in a previously proposed mechanism. On the basis of our mechanism, we propose the doping of ceria by Ni as a means to create oxygen vacancies. Interestingly, the Ni dopant is not directly involved in the catalytic reaction, but serves as a single-atom promoter. Experimental studies confirm the design principles and demonstrate much higher activity for Ni-doped ceria in selective hydrogenation of acetylene.

The Cu\u2013O mean bond length was close to that of the CuO and the Cu atoms in the catalysts are surrounded by approximately four oxygen atoms in their first shell. Copper supported on the ceria-modified titania support catalysts displayed a better performance in the methanol dehydrogenation when compared to copper supported only on titania or on ceria.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": [{"acronym": "", "applications": ["catalyst", "methanol dehydrogenation"], "name": "copper oxide", "formula": "CuO", "structure_or_phase": [""], "description": ["supported on a CeO2\u2013TiO2 system"]}, {"acronym": "", "applications": ["catalyst", "methanol dehydrogenation"], "name": "ceria", "formula": "CeO2", "structure_or_phase": ["cerianite"], "description": [""]}, {"acronym": "", "applications": ["catalyst", "methanol dehydrogenation"], "name": "titania", "formula": "TiO2", "structure_or_phase": ["anatase"], "description": [""]}, {"name": "copper oxide", "formula": "Cu2O", "description": [""], "acronym": "", "structure_or_phase": [""], "applications": [""]}], "gpt3_completion": [{"acronym": "", "applications": ["catalyst", "methanol dehydrogenation"], "name": "copper oxide", "formula": "CuO", "structure_or_phase": [""], "description": ["supported on a CeO2\u2013TiO2 system"]}, {"acronym": "", "applications": ["catalyst", "methanol dehydrogenation"], "name": "ceria", "formula": "CeO2", "structure_or_phase": [""], "description": ["modified titania support"]}, {"acronym": "", "applications": ["catalyst", "methanol dehydrogenation"], "name": "titania", "formula": "TiO2", "structure_or_phase": ["anatase"], "description": ["support"]}]}, {"prompt": "Ceria as a new support of noble metal catalysts for hydrocarbon reactions: chemisorption and catalytic studies\nMetal/cerium-oxide systems were practically not studied in hydrocarbon reactions.

Pt/CeO2 was tested in transformation of n-hexane while Rh/CeO2 in ring opening of methylcyclopentane (MCP). Higher spillover activity was found for the LTR Rh samples than for HTR ones. The opposite was true for Pt. The Rh/ceria samples showed ordinary catalytic behavior: structure insensitivity was observed for the first C\ue5f8C bond cleavage of MCP on Rh/ceria and the further reaction of the ring opening intermediates was affected by the surface hydrogen concentration. The Pt/LTR samples showed catalytic properties similar to EUROPT-1, while the HTR samples were different, namely the higher spillover activity caused high C5-cyclization selectivity on the catalyst with low metal loading, and surprisingly high hydrogenolysis selectivity on that with higher metal loading.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": [{"acronym": "", "applications": ["hydrocarbon reactions", "catalyst"], "name": "", "formula": "Pt", "structure_or_phase": [""], "description": ["ceria-supported"]}, {"acronym": "", "applications": ["hydrocarbon reactions", "catalyst", "ring opening of methylcyclopentane"], "name": "", "formula": "Rh", "structure_or_phase": [""], "description": ["ceria-supported", "metal"]}, {"acronym": "", "applications": [], "name": "ceria", "formula": "CeO2", "structure_or_phase": [""], "description": ["support"]}], "gpt3_completion": [{"acronym": "", "applications": ["catalyst", "hydrocarbon reactions"], "name": "ceria", "formula": "CeO2", "structure_or_phase": [""], "description": ["support", "Pt/CeO2", "Rh/CeO2"]}, {"acronym": "EUROPT-1", "applications": ["catalyst", "hydrocarbon reactions"], "name": "", "formula": "", "structure_or_phase": [""], "description": [""]}]}, {"prompt": "Performance of a solid-state photoelectrochromic device\nThe photoelectrochromic (PEC) device reported in this paper is a new type of switchable system, which combines a dye-sensitised solar cell with an additional electrochromic layer. The colouring process takes place under open-circuit conditions and illumination, and bleaching is achieved under short-circuit conditions. Solid PEC devices in a size up to 10\u00d710cm2 employing a solid Li+ ion conductor, based on organically modified silane (ormolyte) with redox couple, were built and characterised. The addition of the cationic surfactant to the electrolyte improves the stability, colouration and memory effect of the PEC devices. The photopic transmittance of the solid PEC device is varied between 62% (bleached state) and 1.6% (coloured state). The corresponding colouring time under 1 sun illumination is 15min and 15min are needed for bleaching.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": [], "gpt3_completion": []}]
