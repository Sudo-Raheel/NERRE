Nanostructured Al2O3 were employed as a mesoporous scaffold for fabrication of such solar cells. Morphology and thickness of scaffold were shown to be very important for optimization of conversion efficiency of the cells. In this study charge transport in three different structures usually used in Perovskite-based solar cells with Al2O3 scaffold are investigated for the first time. Random walk numerical simulation based on hopping model is utilized for charge transport. Dependency of the diffusion coefficient and collection efficiency of the cells on the morphological parameters is studied here. Optimum thickness for the Perovskite layer and optimum surface roughness and thickness for Al2O3 scaffold to reach a maximum efficiency for Perovskite/Al2O3 based solar cells are achieved in our simulation.\n\n###\n\n",

Herein, we measure the yield and kinetics of hole transfer across the methylammonium lead triiodide perovskite|polymeric hole transport material heterojunction, as a function of the interfacial energy offset, \u03b4E, between the highest occupied molecular orbital of the hole transport material and the valence band edge of the perovskite. A combination of steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence, along with transient absorption spectroscopy, revealed that only a small driving energy (\u03b4E \u223c0.07 eV) is required to induce highly efficient hole transfer. The findings of this paper suggest that further improvements in the open-circuit voltage, and so the power conversion efficiency, of perovskite solar cells could be achieved by incorporating hole transport materials that provide an interfacial energy offset in the range 0 < \u03b4E < 0.18 eV.\n\n###\n\n",

        "prompt": "Formation of lead magnesium niobate (PMN) perovskite phase using a columbite type of precursor together with the addition of excess MgO has been investigated. When MgO and Nb2O5 are reacted with 1:1 stoichiometry, a minor amount (\u223c2%) of Mg4Nb2O9 is formed along with the columbite-type phase which in turn could lead to the formation of a minor amount of \"free Nb2O5\" in the precursor. This may be the reason for the formation of small amounts of pyrochlore phase during the synthesis of PMN perovskite from the stoichiometric 1:1 precursor. However, it has been found that the perovskite phase can easily be stabilized by the addition of a large excess of MgO in the precursor, although this leads to additional Mg-Nb-O phase Mg4Nb2O9, besides the columbite-type phase MgNb2O6. It has been shown that, after this precursor reacts with PbO to form the PMN perovskite, the excess Mg present in the Mg-rich niobate precursor separates out as MgO, as evidenced by X-ray diffraction, which can be removed by leaching with dilute nitric acid, thus forming pure PMN.\n\n###\n\n",

To the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, such multi-objective optimal datacenter battery management remains relatively unexplored. We solve this optimization problem using a second-order model of battery charge dynamics, coupled with a physics-based model of battery aging via solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) growth. Our optimization study focuses on a classical feedforward-feedback energy management policy, where feedforward control is used for peak shaving, and feedback is used for tracking a desired battery state of charge (SOC). Three feedforward-feedback architectures are examined: a proportional (P) control architecture, a proportional-integral (PI) architecture, and a PI architecture with a deadband in its feedforward path. We optimize these architectures\u2019 parameters using differential evolution, for real datacenter power demand histories. Our results show a significant Pareto tradeoff between dollar savings and battery longevity for all architectures. The introduction of a deadband furnishes a more attractive Pareto front by allowing the feedforward controller to focus on shaving larger peaks. Moreover, the use of integral control improves the robustness of the feedback policy to demand uncertainties and battery pack sizing.\n\n###\n\n",

Inherently safer designs with active or passive protections have became the captious issues that need more attentions paid to. In this study, the worst scenarios on thermal runaway of four commercial batteries were conducted and compared. A customized-made closed testing instrument was utilized to measure and track thermal behaviors of four brands of cylindrical lithium-ion batteries under maximum open circuit voltage condition. Characteristics on thermal hazards of lithium-ion batteries such as onset temperature, maximum temperature, maximum self-heat rate, maximum pressures, battery mass loss, etc. were measured and evaluated. Results point out that one brand of cells reached the maximum temperature and maximum self-heat rate of 590.9\u00a0K and 1,130.4\u00a0K\u00a0min\u22121, respectively. In conclusion, in case of thermal runaway all the lithium-ion batteries will rupture the cell and catch fire automatically owing to the maximum temperatures over the auto-ignition temperature of electrolytes and the maximum pressure higher than four times of maximum allowable working pressure, respectively. In addition, Lithium-ion battery with cathode material of LiFePO4 was verified to be more stable than the lithium-ion battery with cathode material of LiMn2O4 or LiCoO2.\n\n###\n\n",

We perform calculations assuming intraorbital superconducting pairing in FeBSs described by the s\u00b1model. Further, taking into account that the Fermi energy in FeBSs is much larger than the superconducting gaps, we formulate the quasiclassical approximation. This formulation makes our theory suitable for straightforward numerical calculations and more practical compared to previous approaches. Based on this quasiclassical theory, we calculated the conductance of a junction between a single band normal metal and an FeBS. \u00a9 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.\n\n###\n\n",

The physical mechanisms of the non-isothermal formation of the critical state are discussed solving the set of unsteady thermo-electrodynamics equations taking into consideration the unknown moving penetration boundary of the magnetic flux. To make it, the numerical method, which allows to study diffusion phenomena with unknown moving phase-two boundary, is developed. The corresponding non-isothermal flux jump criteria are written. It is proved for the first time that, first, the diffusion phenomena in superconductors have the fission-chain-reaction nature, second, the stability conditions, losses in superconductor and its stable overheating before instability onset are mutually dependent. The results are compared with those following from the existing magnetic instability theory, which does not take into consideration the stable temperature increase of superconductor before the instability onset. It is shown that errors of isothermal approximation are significant for modes closed to adiabatic ones. Therefore, the well-known adiabatic flux jump criterion limits the range of possible stable superconducting states since a correct determination of their stability states must take into account the thermal prehistory of the stable magnetic flux penetration. As a result, the calculation errors in the isothermal approximation will rise when the sweep rate of an external magnetic field or the size of the superconductor\u2019s cross-sectional area increase. The basic conclusions formulated in the framework of the critical state model are verified comparing the experimental results and the numerical analysis of the stability conditions and the temperature dynamics of the helicoid-type superconducting current-carrying element having real voltage\u2013current characteristic. On the whole, the non-isothermal stability conditions expand the existence of allowable stable superconducting states. The non-isothermal approximation permits also to link the theories of the losses, the magnetic instability and the thermal stabilization of superconductors, which are independently developed.\n\n###\n\n",

The unique feature of the high entropy alloys in this study was the high vacancy formation energies compared to other reported high entropy alloys and this is believed to be responsible for their ability to form an amorphous phase and their relative sensitivity to Ni content.\n\n###\n\n",

Spinel structure is confirmed from the analysis of XRD data. Rietveld refinement method is employed to refine the XRD powder data and the structural parameters are calculated from the refinement. Small amount of hematite phase is found in all samples. The SEM, EDAX and XRF analysis reveals respectively the morphology, stoichiometric composition and purity of the powder samples. Using Maximum Entropy Method (MEM) the values of the bond strength between various sites interactions in ferrites are evaluated and compared with theoretical predictions of strengthening/weakening of various sites interactions from the values of interionic distances and interionic bond angles. Ferromagnetic nature of the samples is confirmed from the vibrating sample magnetometer study. The obtained low saturation magnetization values are attributed to presence of second phase.

Gd 50 Co 45 Fe 5 amorphous alloy ribbon with a table-like magnetocaloric effect (MCE) suitable for the ideal Ericsson cycle at room temperature has been developed. In addition to a high magnetic transition temperature of 289 K very close to that of Gd (294 K), a relatively large value of refrigerant capacity (\u223c521 J kg -1 ) has been achieved under a field change of 5 T. This value of refrigerant capacity (RC) is about 27% and 70% larger than those of Gd (\u223c410 J kg -1 ) and Gd 5 Si 2 Ge 2 (\u223c306 J kg -1 ). More importantly, the peak value of magnetic entropy change (-\u0394S Mmax ) approaches a nearly constant value of \u223c3.8 J s kg -1 s K -1 under an applied field change of 0\u223c5 T in a wide temperature span over 40 K around room temperature, which could be used as the candidate working material in the Ericsson-cycle magnetic regenerative refrigerator around room temperature.\n\n###\n\n",

However, the temperature-dependent material properties including thermal conductivity, electric resistivity and Seebeck coefficient make the theoretical analysis challenging. In this work, we propose an approximate analytical solution, in which we evaluate the distribution of the electric resistivity and Thomson coefficient linearly, but the distribution of electric resistivity and Thomson coefficient are still nonlinear. The temperature profile obtained from our approximate analytical model agrees well with numerical prediction. More importantly, the derivative of temperature, which has great influence on the heat flux distribution and efficiency, also agrees well with the numerical results. Then the model is applied to analyze the performance of a thermoelectric element. We show that thermal conductivity is critical factor in the performance of thermoelectric materials including the efficiency.\n\n###\n\n",

X-ray electron and neutron diffraction studies of LaBa2Cu3\u2212xCoxO7\u00b1\u03b4 showed that for smaller concentrations of Co (0.05\u2a7dx\u2a7d0.3) the oxides crystallize in a tetragonal structure, and for higher concentrations, (0.3\u2a7dx\u2a7d1), in an orthorhombic structure. LaBa2Cu2CoO7+\u03b4 showed an orthorhombic to tetragonal structural transition with decreasing oxygen content, and thermal desorption of oxygen from LaBa2Cu2CoO7.35 supported the presence of two types of labile oxygens, O(1) at (0 1 20) and O(6) at (00 1 2). All members of RBa2Cu2CoO7+\u03b4 were semiconducting and the degree of orthorhombicity decreased with decreasing size of the central rare earth ion. Superconductivity was quenched faster in LaBa2Cu3\u2212xCoxO7\u00b1\u03b4 for a lower value of x = 0.1, unlike in the case of YBa2Cu3\u2212xCoxO7\u00b1\u03b4 where superconductivity persists up to x = 0.35. The compounds with x \u2a7e 0.2 were all semiconducting. Magnetic susceptibility studies on LaBa2Cu3\u2212xCoxO7\u00b1\u03b4 suggest a mixed valent state for cobalt.\n\n###\n\n",

Various components for the development of monopropellant thrusters using hydrogen peroxide have been studied, including catalysts, catalytic supports, and design parameters in monopropellant thrusters. As a part of these efforts, an experimental investigation, including design parameters, for a catalyst bed is performed with MnO2-mixed PbO catalysts in a hydrogen peroxide monopropellant thruster. In addition to basic performance of the monopropellant thruster, the response characteristics of rising time and tail-off time are compared with respect to two different catalysts. From the experimental results, it is found that a catalyst with high reactivity is much more preferable for reducing not only rising time but also tail-off time. Tail-off time in case of MnO2-mixed PbO is considerably shortened compared to that of MnO2. Moreover, design parameters, such as catalyst capacity and catalyst bed loading, for designing a catalyst bed in a monopropellant thruster can be suggested from an analysis of all experimental results.\n\n###\n\n",

The metal was supported on active carbon either by direct impregnation or utilizing the ionic liquid as the intermediate phase on the carbon. The influence on selectivity and activity, of the most important variables, such as temperature and pressure, was investigated in a batch reactor. Four consecutive experiments were carried out with each catalyst. The aim with the reuse of catalysts in the batch reactor was to elucidate eventual catalyst deactivation. The decrease in activity was very notable in the case of traditional impregnated catalysts, whereas the novel SSIL-TM (structured supported ionic liquid-transition metal) or Pd in ionic liquid on active carbon essentially maintained its activity in four consecutive batches. The catalysts were characterized with scanning electron microscopy, N2 physisorption, and inductively coupled plasma analysis combined with mass spectroscopy. With the Pt on active carbon fibre catalyst, 80\u2013100% selectivity of carbonyl group hydrogenation was achieved at 15% conversion, whereas the Pd in ionic liquid on ACC catalyst displayed an impressive metal efficiency (citral-to-Pd ratio of 156, mol:mol), selectivity (45%) and activity (92% conversion at 140min) as well as tolerance towards catalyst deactivation. Supported ionic liquids provide a new reaction environment for catalytic transformations.\n\n###\n\n",

In this study we report on the structural, optical and electrical properties of the quaternary chalcogenides CuZn2InTe4 and CuCd2InTe4 which crystallize in the modified zinc-blende crystal structure, and compare their properties with that of CuZn2InSe4. These p-type semiconductors have direct band gaps of about 1eV resulting in relatively high Seebeck coefficient and resistivity values.

The obtained samples are well characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), Raman spectroscopy, thermo gravimetric analyzer (TG) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Moreover, they are also evaluated as electrochemical catalysts in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The results indicate that numerous ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets which are characteristic of few layers (1\u20133 layers) and abundant exposed active edges and defects are well-dispersed in the amorphous carbon network to form MoS2/C composite. As a consequence, the desirable microstructures endow the resultant MoS2/C composite with significantly enhanced catalytic activity for HER such as more positive onset potential, larger current density as well as smaller Tafel slope of 64mVdec\u2212 1 in comparison with the bare MoS2.\n\n###\n\n",

The surface composition of coating before and after alkaline leaching was determined by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. The surface morphologies were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The long-term stability of electrode prepared for alkaline water electrolysis was investigated in 1 M KOH solution with the help of cathodic current-potential curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. It was found that, the NiCuZn coating has a compact and porous structure with good physical stability. Alkaline leaching process further improved the activity of NiCuZn coating in comparison with binary NiCu deposit for the HER. The long-term operation at \u2212100 mA cm\u22122 showed good electrochemical stability over 120 h.\n\n###\n\n",

As substrates polycrystalline gold (y=0.75 mM HReO4) and monocrystalline n-Si(100) (y=40 mM HReO4) were used. The electrochemical growth of rhenium was studied by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical quartz microbalance on gold electrodes. The results found in the potential region before the hydrogen evolution reaction (her) showed that ReO3, ReO2 and Re2O3 with different hydration grades can be formed. In the potential region where the her is occurring, either on gold or n-Si(100) the electrodeposition of metallic rhenium takes place. On both substrates, rhenium films were formed by electrolysis at constant potential and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy technique was used to characterise these deposits. It was concluded that the electrodeposited films were of metallic rhenium and only the uppermost atomic layer contained rhenium oxide species.\n\n###\n\n",

For 0.5\u2a7dx<0.67 the orthorhombic, Pnma, perovskite structure of the end member, SrRuO3, is found. At x=0.67 a phase separation into an Ru-rich Pnma phase and a Co-rich I2/c phase occurs. The I2/c form is also found for x=1.0 but another orthorhombic phase, Imma, obtains for x=1.33 and 1.5. Reductive weight losses indicate negligible oxygen non-stoichiometry, i.e., \u03b4\u223c0, for all compositions even those rich in Co. High-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) indicates that cobalt is high-spin Co3+ or high-spin Co4+ for all x. Appropriate combinations of Ru4+, Ru5+, HS Co3+ and HS Co4+ are proposed for each x which are consistent with the observed Ru(Co)\u2013O distances. Significant amounts of Co4+ must be present for large x values to explain the short observed distances. Broad maxima in the d.c. susceptibilities are found between 78 and 97K with increasing x, along with zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) divergences suggesting glassy magnetic freezing. A feature near 155K for all samples indicates a residual amount of ferromagnetic SrRuO3 not detected by X-ray diffraction.\n\n###\n\n",

The ordering process is accomplished at (Formula presented) where the charge-exchange-(CE) type antiferromagnetism sets in. Despite the superstructure, the tilt pattern of Pnma type is preserved down to the lowest temperatures. The second compound, (Formula presented) is ferromagnetic below (Formula presented) The charge ordering occurs at (Formula presented) and is accompanied by the onset of the CE antiferromagnetism. The transition is associated with a change of the tilt pattern from (Formula presented) to Imma type. The low-temperature phase is commensurate both in the structural and magnetic sense. It is argued that the main energy gain of the charge ordering in (Formula presented) (1:1) perovskites results from electron-exchange interactions favored by the (Formula presented) orbital polarization. The onset of the incommensurate configurations can be understood supposing the existence of a soft lattice mode in which the electron transfer (charge-density wave) is correlated with dynamics of (Formula presented) orbitals. \u00a9 2000 The American Physical Society.\n\n###\n\n",

The present study theoretically evaluates the de-solvation energies of Li, Na, and Mg ions to organic electrolyte solvents. The Na-ion complexes revealed commonly smaller de-solvation energies compared to the Li-ion complexes due to the weaker Lewis acidity, while the solvation structures were similar to each other. The Mg-ion complexes showed remarkably larger de-solvation energies because of the double positive charge. The increase of coordination number, which was associated with the change in the solvation structure, was observed for the Mg-ion complexes. Detailed analysis revealed good correlations between the de-solvation energies and the electrostatic potentials made by the solvents, as well as the chemical hardness of the solvents.\n\n###\n\n",

Because of its direct contact with the active material, a binder can be interpreted as an interfacial layer and as a local part of the electrolyte, the properties of which greatly depend on the interaction with the liquid electrolyte. In this work we demonstrate how a carefully chosen binder can create a specific surface environment that can protect graphite from exfoliation when the binder exhibits poor solubility in the electrolyte solvent and good surface adhesion to the active material. The exceptional stability of graphite electrodes containing poly(acrylic acid) sodium salt (PAA-Na) and carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt (CMC-Na), respectively, in a PC-rich electrolyte is explained through the understanding of binder swelling and functionality. Interfacial resistances and electrochemical stability were investigated with impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic cycling. Electrode morphologies and distributions of material were analysed with SEM and EDX. Evidence is presented that the surface selectivity increases with concentration of functional groups and polymer flexibility. Therefore only the less selective, stiff polymer with less functional groups, CMC-Na, provides sufficient protection at low binder contents.\n\n###\n\n",

In this work, we studied thermal interactions between cathode materials Li2MnO3, xLi2MnO3.(1\u2009\u2212\u2009x)Li(MnNiCo)O2,LiNi0.33Mn0.33Co0.33O2, LiNi0.4Mn0.4Co0.2O2, LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4, LiMn(or Fe)PO4, and battery solutions containing ethylene carbonate (EC) or propylene carbonate (PC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC) or ethylmethyl carbonate (EMC) and LiPF6 salt in the temperature range of 40\u2013400\u00a0\u00b0C. It was found that these materials are stable chemically and well performing in LiPF6-based solutions up to 60\u00a0\u00b0C. The thermal decomposition of the electrolyte solutions starts >180\u00a0\u00b0C. The macro-structural transformations of cathode materials upon exothermic reactions were studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray difraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies have shown that the exothermic reactions in the temperature range of 60\u2013140\u00a0\u00b0C lead to partial decomposition of both the cathode material and electrolyte solution. The systems thus formed consisted of partially decomposed solutions and partially chemically delithiated cathode materials covered by reactions products. Thermal reactions terminate and this system reaches equilibrium at about 120\u00a0\u00b0C. It remains stable up to the beginning of the solution decomposition at about 180\u00a0\u00b0C. The increased content of surface Li2CO3 is found to significantly affect the thermal processes at high temperature range due to extensive exothermic decomposition at low temperatures.\n\n###\n\n",

        "prompt": "I. quantization as group extension\nQuantization is described as group extension of the linear space F of classical objects considered as an Abelian group by the (Abelian) group of complex numbers. The factor of the extension is studied in some detail and its general form is derived under the assumption of analyticity. A certain class of representations of the extended group is described in terms of functions over F* (the dual to F) with multiplication determined by a factor. The antisymmetric part of this factor determines the commutation relations. The method is extended to the case when F consists of generators of a Grassmann algebra. The procedure is illustrated on examples in which F consists of functions over an index set J. Four cases are treated: one in which the index set J is discrete and finite (time independent quantum mechanics), another in which J = R \u00d7 {1, 2,..., n} (time dependent quantum mechanics), a third one with J = MH (quantum field theory of fields over Minkowski space) and finally the fourth case with J = MH \u00d7 S2 (quantum field theory of fields over Minkowski space extended in a relativistic way by a two-dimensional space of internal degrees of freedom). Further restrictions upon the factors follow if one requires invariance with respect to the group of motions of the considered space. \u00a9 1988.\n\n###\n\n",

In the case of fractals it is shown on specific examples that two different fixed points are found, at variance with periodic structures.

No local minimum in the dependence of the total energy on the lattice parameter has been found. Such a polymorph would be approximately 5 eV atom\u22121 less stable than diamond, suggesting that its synthesis is very unlikely. This finding is consistent with older density functional calculations and contradicts recent results of LCAO calculations, which have been used to support the interpretation of experimental data as showing the existence of a metallic carbon polymorph with space group symmetry Fm 3 \u0304m.\n\n###\n\n",

Development of space weather forecasting centers\nThe present work is the third of a three-part review of space weather in Latin America, specifically observing its evolution in three countries (Argentina, Brazil and Mexico). This work presents the decision process for the spinning off of space weather prediction centers from space science groups with our interpretation of the reasons/opportunities that lead to this. Lastly, the constraints for the progress in space weather monitoring, research, and forecast are listed with recommendations to overcome them, which we believe will lead to the access of key variables for the monitoring and forecasting space weather, which will allow these centers to better monitor space weather and issue warnings, \u200bwatches and alerts.\n\n###\n\n",

These transformations are induced by the guest-exchange method, i.e., soaking the crystals of CA complex in liquid guest. In the present study, 2-, 3-, and 4-fluorobenzyl alcohol (2-, 3-, and 4-FBzOH, respectively) and water were used as guest molecules. The guest exchange from 2-to 4-FBzOH retained essentially both the amphiphilic bilayered structure and space group P21 of the starting complex. Similarly, the exchange from 3- to 4-FBzOH retained the bilayered structure and space group P21; in CA-3-FBzOH, the guest molecules in the channel are not related by 21 symmetry; if the crystals are soaked in 4-FBzOH, exchange of guests takes place, associated with the appearance of 21 symmetry between the guest molecules. The exchange from 3-FBzOH to water caused a drastic structural change accompanied by space group change from P21 to P6522. The exchange from 2-FBzOH to water afforded two types of CA-H2O structure: one has space group P6522 and the other has the bilayered structure with space group P21. In contrast to CA\u20142- and \u20143-FBzOH, the crystal of CA-4-FBzOH did not undergo any transformation. Several transformations accompany the conspicuous change in the hydrogen bond network which plays an important role in constructing the crystal lattice. Such phenomena indicate the crystal flexibility of the CA inclusion complex. \u00a9 1995, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.\n\n###\n\n",

Our results contradict these conclusions; for 0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.16, BaCe1 \u2212 xNdxO3 \u2212 x 2 is orthorhombic, space group Pmcn. At x = 0.2, the powder data are consistent with either space group Pmcn or Cmcm, and could not be distinguished using structural-model-free fits due to increased line broadening present in this sample. The smaller number of reflections in space group Pmcn favours this space group for x = 0.2. The deviation from cubic symmetry has been determined from a calculation of the scalar spontaneous strain, assuming that the dopant-dependent effects in the thermal expansion properties are small in BaCe1 \u2212 xNdxO3 \u2212 x 2 . The spontaneous strain decreases with increasing neodymium doping showing the deviation from an ideal cubic aristotype reduces with doping level. There is some evidence for saturation in the spontaneous strain at x > 0.2.\n\n###\n\n",

Through constant pressure simulations, two high-pressure phases of MgF2 are estimated. MgF2 undergoes a phase transformation from the rutile-type structure to the CaCl2-type structure with space group Pnnm at 10\u201320GPa. Another phase transformation from the CaCl2-type structure to the \u03b1-PbCl2-type structure with space group Pnma occurs at 80\u201390GPa. The later transformation is based on three intermediate phases with space groups P21/m, P21 and P212121. These phase transitions are also analyzed from the total energy and enthalpy calculations. These phase changes should occur around 9 and 35GPa from enthalpy calculations, respectively.\n\n###\n\n",

These structures differ from the structure of the previously studied nonaborate Pb3(OH)[B9O16][B(OH)3] (space group P31c) in the occupation of the zeolite nonaframework, which, in the case of the (Ba,Na) borate, contains a larger number of cations and OH groups. Despite this difference, all the structures have a high trigonal or pseudotrigonal symmetry, which suggests the existence of the structure type or the family of nonaborates. The structural similarity is violated by the presence of B(OH)41\u2212 tetrahedra instead of neutral trigonal groups B(OH)3 in channels of the (Ba,Na) borate. The latter polyhedra are characterized by a pseudomonoclinic arrangement that corresponds to the space group Cc with the true triclinic group P1. The ability of nonaborates to generate the optical second harmonic as a function of the specific features of their crystal structures is discussed.\n\n###\n\n",

It is demonstrated that a ceria supported gold catalyst exhibits the same catalytic activity profile in both setups when using room temperature CO oxidation as model reaction. Detailed analysis of the UV\u2013Vis and visible Raman spectra during reaction reveals changes in the oxidation state of gold and the number of oxygen-vacancy defects in ceria. DRIFT spectra provide complementary information on adsorbates, in particular carbonates and hydrogen carbonates, as well as hydroxyl groups. Time-resolved operando spectra allow for a direct correlation with catalytic activity thus providing detailed information on activation and deactivation processes of ceria supported gold particles.\n\n###\n\n",

Pd/ceria exhibited much higher activities than either ceria alone or Pd/silica, demonstrating a cooperative effect between Pd and ceria. Pd/ceria and Ni/ceria showed essentially the same activities and were much more active than either Co/ceria or Fe/ceria. Reaction orders on Pd/ceria were approximately zeroth-order in CO, half-order in H2O, inverse-half-order in CO2 and inverse-first-order in H2. Diffuse-reflectance FTIR measurements on Pd/ceria indicate the ceria exists in a reduced state under WGS conditions and is covered by carbonate species that are removed only by reoxidation of ceria The implications of these results for improved WGS catalysis are discussed.\n\n###\n\n",

The synthesized CeO2-meso materials possess narrow pore size distributions of 5.1\u20135.4nm and tunable surface areas (109\u2013182 m2 g\u22121). As heterogeneous catalysts in the transesterification of ethylene carbonate (EC) with methanol to dimethyl carbonate (DMC), CeO2-meso materials demonstrate superior catalytic performance to the commercial ceria. N2 adsorption\u2013desorption and CO2-TPD characterization results indicate that the catalytic activity obtained over various CeO2-meso samples depends on their surface areas and basicity. The highest activity is achieved over CeO2-meso-400, affording a DMC yield as much as 73.3%, together with excellent recycling ability. Besides the transesterification of EC with methanol, CeO2-meso is found to be able to catalyze the reactions of other cyclic carbonates and alcohols. In view of the high catalytic performance along with the convenience in catalyst preparation, CeO2-meso-400 compares favorably with the ionic liquids as well as other ceria-based catalytic systems.\n\n###\n\n",

Ceria supports were prepared using the hydrothermal method where the particle shape is manipulated by controlling the pH and pressure of the precipitation environment. Structural characterization with TEM and XRD showed the two morphologies to be similar in particle size, but different in the exposure of different crystal planes. The nano-cubes had a higher exposure of the (110) plane, which is known to have a higher affinity for creating anion vacancies and surface defects. Controlled atmosphere X-ray absorption fine structure analysis, temperature programmed reduction/oxidation, dispersion measurements and steady-state reaction performance tests showed significant differences between the two catalysts. Co catalysts supported on nanocubes showed higher reducibility compared to those supported on nanorods or commercial supports of similar particle size. These catalysts also showed high H2 and CO2 yields in the 400\u2013500\u00b0C range whereas Co/CeO2(NR) had limited carbon cleavage activity and were only active for dehydrogenation and dehydration. The superior performance of Co/CeO2(NC) catalysts is thought to be due to a combination of factors, including improved metal dispersion, increased reducibility and higher oxygen mobility.\n\n###\n\n",

Pt/CeO2 was tested in transformation of n-hexane while Rh/CeO2 in ring opening of methylcyclopentane (MCP). Higher spillover activity was found for the LTR Rh samples than for HTR ones. The opposite was true for Pt. The Rh/ceria samples showed ordinary catalytic behavior: structure insensitivity was observed for the first C\ue5f8C bond cleavage of MCP on Rh/ceria and the further reaction of the ring opening intermediates was affected by the surface hydrogen concentration. The Pt/LTR samples showed catalytic properties similar to EUROPT-1, while the HTR samples were different, namely the higher spillover activity caused high C5-cyclization selectivity on the catalyst with low metal loading, and surprisingly high hydrogenolysis selectivity on that with higher metal loading.\n\n###\n\n",

Lithium titanate (Li4Ti5O12) was used as the positive electrode and lithium metal as the negative electrode. The performance of the all-solid-state cell is compared with a cell with an identical electrode setup but a liquid electrolyte (1 M LiPF6 in EC:DMC). All measurements were carried out at a temperature of 60\u00b0C. For the all-solid-state cells, 81% of the theoretical discharge capacity is reached for a discharge rate of 10 \u03bcA, but a capacity fade of 1.6% per charge-discharge cycle is observed. The electrochemical stability of the LiBH4-LiI solid solution was investigated using cyclic voltammetry and is found to be limited to 3 V. The impedance of the battery cells was measured using impedance spectroscopy. A strong correlation is found between the change in the discharge capacity of the cells and changes in the cell impedance over 200 charge-discharge cycles. This is expectedly due to the possible formation of passivating areas in the cell and/or loss of contact area between the electrolyte and the electrodes.\n\n###\n\n",

        "prompt": "Strategies for solid-state NMR investigations of supramolecular assemblies with large subunit sizes\nSolid-state NMR is a versatile tool to study structure and dynamics of insoluble and non-crystalline biopolymers. Supramolecular protein assemblies are formed by self-association of multiple copies of single small-sized proteins. Because of their high degree of local order, solid-state NMR spectra of such systems exhibit an unusually high level of resolution, rendering them an ideal target for solid-state NMR investigations. Recently, our group has solved the structure of one particular supramolecular assembly, the type-iii-secretion-system needle. The needle subunit comprises around 80 residues. Many interesting supramolecular assemblies with unknown structure have subunits larger in size, which requires development of tailored solid-state NMR strategies to address their structures. In this \u201cPerspective\u201d article, we provide a view on different approaches to enhance sensitivity and resolution in biological solid-state NMR with a focus on the possible application to supramolecular assemblies with large subunit sizes.\n\n###\n\n",

This review (with 128 refs.) summarizes recent progress on solid-state nanopore-based DNA single-molecule detection and sequencing. Following a description of the principles of the technique, we focus on the fabrication of solid-state nanopores. We then treat the spatial and temporal resolution that can be accomplished with them in terms of DNA translocation and sequencing. Finally, we summarize novel methods for detection such as tunneling current sensing and multichannel sensing, and then end up with a conclusion on developments and prospects of future nanopore technology.\n                Graphical abstractSpatial resolution and temporal resolution are two critical issues for solid-state nanopores toward DNA sequencing. 2-D materials such as graphene, BN and MoS2 and methods for speed control of DNA translocation are warranting a\u00a0promising future of applications of solid-state nanopore\u00a0technology.\n\n###\n\n",
