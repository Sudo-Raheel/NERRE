### Installing and running the code

Specific instructions for each task are given in the subdirectories in the `readme.md` files. Running the scripts is done either through the command line (`python <script_name.py> [options]`) or through Jupyter notebook. Running the scripts does not require installation, but does require the packages in the `requirements.txt` files.

Demo and expected output are given in the `readme.md` files in each subdirectory. Expected runtimes are several seconds to several minutes.
